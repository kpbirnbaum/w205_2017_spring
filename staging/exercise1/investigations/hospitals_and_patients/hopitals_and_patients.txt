Here I am checking the correlation between the survey scores and the scores that I created as well as the correlation between survey scores and the overall hospital scores given and survey scores and readmission compare rate. My scores have a negative correlation between -.26 and -.37 with survey scores whereas the correlation with overall hospital scores falls between .5 and .6 and the correlation with hospital compare is about .21. 

I would therefore conclude that either the surveys had a significant effect on how the overall
rating for the hospital was calculated and the score by procedures were not
taken into account or that my measure is inaccurate due to the reasons
mentioned in my first response (unimportant procedure getting too much weight).

The results of my findings are below:
