The goal was to define the top 10 hospitals in terms of high-quality care i.e those that most consistently score high for a variety of procedures. Since both the effective care table and the readmissions table had measures I decided to use both in my calculation of high quality care. I took the weighted average of each according to how many hospitals provided the given measure (for the readmission measures I took 100-score since a lower score is deemed a better score). 

I then normalized the scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation and added the overall score of the scores grouped by hospital.

I deemed the top 10 scores the top 10 hospitals.

My table contains all of the top scores, but the overall ratings and
readmission compare rates aren't where I hoped they would be. I stuck with
my score since I do not have an in depth view of how their rating was computed
and mine went in depth in taking into account their scores according to
measure and readmission. My table contains all of the top scores, but the
overall ratings and readmission compare rates aren't where I hoped they
would be. I kept hospital overall score (which I didn't use in my measure as I
felt this would be cheating in finding an overall score for the definition of
high quality care)
to see how I compared and there was actually a negative correlation. Although
I will admit that the factor that throws off the correlation may be related to
unimportant measures conducted by more hospitals getting a heavier weight. I
have tried filtering it down though to no avail.
