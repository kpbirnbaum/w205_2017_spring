For measure variability I simply looked at the measures with the highest standard deviation in scores and ranked them accordingly. I filtered out any procedures that were not performed by at least 100 hospitals.

In terms of finding procedure variability checking the overall average spread
seemed to be the best measure.

Results are below:

Measure_name	Measure_ID	Measure_std	num_hosp
Appropriate Follow-Up Interval for Normal Colonoscopy in Average Risk Patients
OP_29	24.95176302	2416
Admit Decision Time to ED Departure Time for Admitted Patients	ED_2b
22.12350809	2211
Colonoscopy Interval for Patients with a History of Adenomatous Polyps -
Avoidance of Inappropriate Use	OP_30	20.27667421	2057
Head CT or MRI Scan Results for Acute Ischemic Stroke or Hemorrhagic Stroke
Patients who Received Head CT or MRI Scan Interpretation Within 45 minutes of
ED Arrival	OP_23	19.34856215	1217
Thrombolytic Therapy	STK_4	18.48372358	561
Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention-
Reporting Rate	OP_3b	16.90079477	375
Median Time to Pain Management for Long Bone Fracture	OP_21	16.18788598
3366
Healthcare workers given influenza vaccination	IMM_3_OP_27_FAC_ADHPCT
14.88256579	3976
Median Time from ED Arrival to Provider Contact for ED patients	OP_20
14.86550442	3670
Influenza Immunization	IMM_2	13.90660851	3482


I know it may be difficult to read here given the length of some of the
measure names I therefore provided another table with just measure_ids so you
can get a better idea of what the table looks like:

Measure_ID	Measure_std	num_hosp
OP_29	24.95176302	2416
ED_2b	22.12350809	2211
OP_30	20.27667421	2057
OP_23	19.34856215	1217
STK_4	18.48372358	561
OP_3b	16.90079477	375
OP_21	16.18788598	3366
IMM_3_OP_27_FAC_ADHPCT	14.88256579	3976
OP_20	14.86550442	3670
IMM_2	13.90660851	3482
